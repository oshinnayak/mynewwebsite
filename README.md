# MyNewWebsite

This repository is an experimental project by oshinnayak for experimentation and learning. It contains a personal/static website used to try ideas, experiments, and prototypes.

Status: Experimental

Usage:
- If the project is purely static, open index.html in your browser.
- If it uses a dev server, run the project's normal start command (e.g., npm run dev).

That's it — simple and experimental.
